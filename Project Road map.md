For the next 5 weeks after phase 1 is finished, do phase 2

Phase 2 tasks:
Build a simple game engine with the following requirements:

    Engine Design
        Design the engine to support any type of 3D game.
        Use an ECS (Entity-Component-System) architecture.
    
    Scene Management
        Load the scene from a data file.
        The scene file should define:
            Paths to assets (shaders, textures, models).
            Entities and their components.
            System configurations.
        Ensure the scene can be changed without recompiling the engine.
    
    Rendering Configuration via Scene File
        Configure shaders, meshes, textures, samplers, and pipeline state (back face culling, depth testing, blending, color/depth masks) for each entity.
        Configure post-processing shaders and their settings.
        Configure sky texture and shader.
    
    Entities and Components
        Allow full scene graph definition (entities with parent-child relationships and relative transformations).
        Implement at least the following components:
            Mesh Renderer: defines which material and mesh to use.
            Camera: defines camera attributes (type, FOV, near/far planes, orthographic height if applicable).
    
    Engine Architecture Implementation
        Implement a World class to hold entities.
        Each entity should contain:
            A list of components.
            Name, transformation, and pointer to parent.
        Implement an abstract Component class with:
            Virtual functions (e.g., deserialization).
            Reference to owning entity.
        Extend Component to create MeshRenderer and Camera components.
    
    Asset Management
        Implement singleton asset loader classes for shaders, textures, meshes, and materials.
        Assets must be loaded from the scene file and shared between components or systems.
        Materials should include pipeline state and other relevant properties (e.g., transparency).
        Implement at least:
            Material (abstract) -> TintedMaterial, TexturedMaterial.
    
    Deserialization
        Implement deserialization functions for:
            Components.
            Assets.
            Scene file.
    
    Rendering System
        Implement a forward renderer system that:
            Loops over entities.
            Finds cameras and drawable entities.
            Sorts entities: opaque -> sky -> transparent (far to near).
            Applies post-processing effects if configured.
    
    Flexibility
        You may modify the architecture, but must satisfy all project requirements.
